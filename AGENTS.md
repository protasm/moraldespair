# AGENTS.md

## Purpose

This file provides **orientation and guardrails** for automated agents (including Codex) and human contributors working in this repository.

Before performing **any task**, agents **must read and internalize** the documents listed below.

---

## Required Reading (In Order)

1. **OVERVIEW.md**  
   This document defines:
   - The identity and goals of the project
   - The relationship to the legacy MUD *Moral Decay*
   - The phased development model and constraints, which are mandatory unless explicitly overridden

2. **CODE-STYLE.md**  
   This document defines:
   - LPC formatting and style conventions
   - File organization patterns
   - Naming conventions
   - Acceptable vs. discouraged abstractions

   Agents should assume that **CODE-STYLE.md is authoritative**, even if other files appear inconsistent.

3. **PROSE.md**  
   This document defines:
   - Room naming rules
   - Room description length and structure
   - Narrative tone and restraint
   - Sensory and atmospheric writing conventions

   Prose is treated as a **first-class system** in this project. Agents must not generate descriptive text that violates these constraints.

---
3. **PHASE1.md**  
   This document defines:
   - Guidance as how to transform rooms and descriptions to appear "aged" and "abandoned".


## Summary for Agents

- Read **OVERVIEW.md** first to understand the project’s intent and current phase
- Follow **CODE-STYLE.md** when writing or modifying any code
- Follow **PROSE.md** when writing or modifying any player-facing text

When in doubt, favor restraint, clarity, and silence over completeness or cleverness.
