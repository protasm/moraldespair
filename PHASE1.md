# PHASE 1 — AGING

## Purpose

Phase 1 defines the **aged and abandoned world state** of *Moral Despair*: a complete, explorable landscape that has already undergone its collapse and been left behind.

Nothing here is in motion.  
Nothing is being rebuilt.  
No one is waiting.

The world exists as it was found — long after its makers vanished — carrying only the quiet weight of what once mattered.

Phase 1 exists to present a coherent, deserted world whose meaning is derived from what remains, and from what has been forgotten.

## Core Concept: Aging as Outcome, Not Process

“Aging” in Phase 1 does **not** occur dynamically.

Instead, the world is presented as if time has already finished its work:

- Cities stand empty, not under siege.
- Institutions are absent, not failing.
- Cultures are gone, not struggling to survive.
- Violence has ended, not paused.

Players are not witnesses to collapse — they are **late arrivals**, exploring a world that has already moved on without them.


---

## World State Assumptions

By the time Phase 1 begins:

- Organized society has vanished completely.
- No governing bodies, armies, religions, or economies remain active.
- The world has been unobserved for generations.
- Nature has begun to reclaim civilization, but without urgency.
- Structures persist only because they were once important enough to endure neglect.

There is no authoritative explanation for *why* this happened.  
What survives does not explain itself, and nothing remembers the truth well enough to speak it aloud.

## Loss of Names and Memory

All **original place names are gone**.

The names given to streets, districts, landmarks, and cities in the former world no longer survive in memory, record, or speech. Whatever meanings those names once carried have eroded along with the people who used them.

In Phase 1:

- Locations are known only by **descriptive, later-imposed names**
- Names reflect appearance, atmosphere, or emotional residue
- Names are imprecise, utilitarian, and often somber

For example:
- What was once *Park Place* may now be known as *Dismal Park*
- A former market district might be called *The Empty Stalls*
- A castle keep may simply be *The Broken High Walls*

These names do not claim historical accuracy.  
They exist only to help the living describe what they see, not what once was.

The original world’s language has faded along with its certainty.

## Manifestations of Aging

Aging is expressed through **environmental storytelling**, not mechanics.

### Architecture
- Buildings remain but are damaged, hollowed, or partially collapsed.
- Defensive structures outlast domestic ones.
- Grand buildings decay unevenly, suggesting former priorities.
- Doors hang open or are gone entirely; rooms are exposed to sky and weather.

### Geography
- Roads still exist, but are fractured, buried, or misaligned.
- City layouts are legible enough to imply former order.
- Natural growth intrudes quietly rather than violently.
- The boundary between “civilized” and “wild” is blurred and uncertain.

### Objects & Artifacts
- Objects persist without context or explanation.
- Tools outnumber comforts.
- Items imply former use but offer no stories.
- Written records are rare, damaged, or too incomplete to clarify the past.

### Absence
What is missing defines the world as much as what remains:

- No signs of daily life continuing
- No routines, commerce, or governance
- No voices to explain what was lost
- No indication that anyone expects a return

## Player Experience Goals

Phase 1 should evoke:

- Quiet, solitary exploration
- Sadness without urgency
- Curiosity without answers
- Familiarity stripped of reassurance

The player should feel that this world was once full — and that they have arrived long after it emptied.


---

## Mechanical Constraints (Intentional Limitations)

Phase 1 deliberately avoids:

- World regeneration or renewal
- NPC-driven economic or social systems
- Dynamic political or cultural change
- Time-based rebuilding or decay

Any interactivity serves **observation and discovery**, not restoration.

The world does not respond.  
It only endures.


---

## Relationship to Future Phases

Phase 1 establishes the **emotional and historical baseline** of the world.

Later phases may:
- Introduce new life or settlers
- Allow limited rebuilding
- Layer new stories over old foundations

But Phase 1 remains the immutable reference point — the silent foundation beneath all later meaning.


---

## Summary

Phase 1 is the world **after it has been abandoned**, but before it has been repurposed.

Time has passed.  
Names have been forgotten.  
What remains is quiet, incomplete, and unconcerned with explanation.

Aging is not something the player watches happen.

Aging is where the player begins.
