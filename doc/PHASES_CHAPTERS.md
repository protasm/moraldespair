"Phase" refers to a period of game development with tasks, issues, and milestones.
- Phase 0 represents the general state of the legacy world;
- Phase 1 is the first phase of development in Moral Despair.

"Chapter" refers to part of a story unfolding over time.
- Players will start playing the game in Chapter 1 and advance to Chapter 2, Chapter 3, and so on.

Phases and Chapters need not be coextensive.  For example, it may be necessary to complete
more than one Phase of development before Chapter 1 is complete and ready for play.
