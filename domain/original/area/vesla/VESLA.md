# Vesla

## Overview

Vesla is the first city players encounter in *Moral Despair*. It serves as both an anchor to the legacy world and a statement of intent for the rebooted game: familiar in shape, altered by time, and largely hollowed out.

The city evokes the feel of a **medieval Bruges**—narrow stone streets, tight angles, and dense urban planning shaped by trade and water rather than symmetry or grandeur. Everything feels close-set and inward-facing, built for foot traffic, carts, and slow movement rather than spectacle.

## City Layout

At the core of Vesla lies a **square**, formed by four major streets or thoroughfares. These streets define the city’s heart and establish its primary navigation loop.

- Each side of the square is lined with structures that once housed businesses, shops, guild halls, and civic spaces
- Smaller streets, alleys, and interior rooms branch off **perpendicularly** from the square on all sides
- These branches lead into dense clusters of rooms rather than wide open areas, reinforcing the city’s compact feel

Despite this former centrality, **the heart of the square is now empty**. Whatever monument, market, or gathering place once occupied it is gone, leaving only open space and silence.

## Player Starting Location

Players begin the game in a **Sanctuary** located just **north of the northeast corner** of the square.

From this elevated, sheltered position, the city unfolds downward and outward. The square is nearby but not immediately entered, allowing players a moment of orientation before stepping fully into Vesla proper.

## Castle and Southern Boundary

At the **southwest corner** of the square stands the entrance to a **castle area**. This entrance marks a transition from civic space to fortified authority and hints at a different scale and tone beyond the city streets.

Running along the **entire southern edge of the square**, just beyond it, is a **castle moat**. The water forms a hard boundary between the city and the castle’s outer defenses, reinforcing the sense that the square once served as an interface between everyday life and power.

## Tone and Atmosphere

Vesla feels built for trade and routine rather than ceremony. Stone walls crowd close. Streets bend slightly rather than running true. Water is never far away.

The city suggests commerce long since ended: guild signs without owners, doorways without voices, and streets that once carried carts now left to echoes and weather. The layout remains legible, but its purpose has faded.

Vesla is not ruined by catastrophe so much as **emptied by time**.

## Phase 1 State of the City

In **Phase 1**, Vesla is **abandoned and silent**.

No living population remains, and no collective memory of the city survives. Streets, guild halls, businesses, and services no longer have names. What these places once were is no longer recorded or spoken of, only implied through structure and decay.

Room descriptions may **hint at former purpose**, but only in broad, generic terms. Language should suggest rot, disuse, and erosion rather than active function. Avoid specific roles, titles, or institutional language. A space may feel as though it *once served* a purpose, but that purpose should never be clearly defined.

The city should feel **legible but forgotten**—built with intent, now left without meaning.

## Phase Notes for Room Authors

Every room file in Vesla may contain a comment near the top of the file marked:

```
PHASE-0
```

This comment describes the room’s **original nature** before the fall of the city.

In Phase 1:

- If available, use the `PHASE-0` comment only as **background context**
- Translate it into a description of a **similar place**, abandoned for approximately **200 years**
- Do **not** reference the original function directly or by name
- Do **not** imply current use, ownership, or memory

The goal is not to describe what the room *was*, but to show what remains **after that meaning is gone**.

When in doubt, describe **material, layout, and decay**, and let the implication do the rest.
