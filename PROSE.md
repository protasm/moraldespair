## Purpose

This document defines the **authoritative prose and narrative style** for *Moral Despair*.

The primary goal of prose in this mudlib is to **say a lot with a little**. Descriptions should be evocative, restrained, and immersive without overwhelming the player with text.

Prose is a core system in Moral Despair. Treat it with the same care as code.

## Core Prose Philosophy

1. **Tight and concise, but emotionally loaded**  
   Every word should earn its place.

2. **Atmosphere over exposition**  
   The world should suggest its history, not explain it.

3. **Less text, more weight**  
   Immersion comes from implication, not volume.

4. **Let the player feel on their own**  
   Never instruct the player how to feel.

## Room Names

Room names are intentionally minimal.

### Rules

- Use **one or two words** whenever possible
- Three words is the absolute maximum
- Capitalize **every word**
- **Never** begin a room name with "A" or "An"

### Good Examples

- `Broken Causeway`
- `West Gate`
- `Fallen Tower`
- `Salt Flats`

### Avoid

- `A Broken Causeway`
- `An Old Road`
- `The Ruins of the West Gate`
- Overly poetic or sentence-like titles

Room names should act as anchors, not descriptions.

---

## Room Descriptions

### Length

- **Two to three sentences** is ideal
- **Four sentences maximum**
- One sentence is acceptable only in rare, intentional cases

### Style Guidelines

- Favor concrete imagery over abstraction
- Allow some language overlap between adjacent rooms, but avoid copy-paste repetition
- Vary sentence structure and cadence across nearby rooms

Descriptions should feel curated, not procedurally generated.

---

## Emotional Restraint

**Never tell the player how they feel.**

Avoid language that dictates emotion, such as:

- "You feel uneasy"
- "This place makes you sad"
- "You are filled with dread"

Instead, let emotion emerge naturally from the environment, pacing, and silence.

The player supplies the feeling. The world supplies the cause.

## Ambience and Sensory Detail

Ambience is strongly encouraged, but must be handled indirectly.

### Rules

- Do **not** use second-person sensory framing
- Avoid phrases like:
  - "You see"
  - "You hear"
  - "You smell"

### Preferred Approach

State sensory details as facts of the world:

- "A hidden cricket chirps nearby."
- "A light breeze wafts across the field here."
- "The air carries the scent of damp stone and rot."
- "Cold fog clings low to the ground."

This keeps the prose immersive without breaking perspective.

---

## Duplication and Variation

Some duplication of language between adjacent rooms is acceptable and often desirable, especially for:

- Large open areas
- Roads, plains, or corridors
- Transitional spaces

However:

- Vary at least one image, detail, or sentence structure per room
- Avoid identical descriptions across multiple rooms

The world should feel continuous, not copied.

---

## What to Avoid

- Walls of text
- Lore dumps
- Overly poetic or self-indulgent language
- Modern slang or meta commentary
- Emotional instructions to the player

---

## Prose Authority

This file is **authoritative**.

If a conflict arises between:
- Existing room descriptions
- Personal writing style
- External mudlib conventions

**PROSE.md wins.**

When in doubt, remove words.
